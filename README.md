# Investigating the Impact of Travel and Rest on an NBA Win/Loss Predictive Model

## Repository Outline

Data Preprocessing steps were completed in [dataset prep.Rmd](https://github.com/Andrew-W-Payne/CIND820/blob/main/dataset%20prep.Rmd) using:
- [df.csv](https://github.com/Andrew-W-Payne/CIND820/blob/main/df.csv) (the original dataset with minor preparations for ease of use)
- [distance.csv](https://github.com/Andrew-W-Payne/CIND820/blob/main/distance.csv) (a matrix of distances between NBA cities in km, prepared as described in dataset prep.Rmd)
- [timezones.csv](https://github.com/Andrew-W-Payne/CIND820/blob/main/timezones.csv) (a matrix of timezone differences between NBA cities, prepared manually in Excel and detailed further in dataset prep.Rmd). 

This outputs the file [df processed.csv](https://github.com/Andrew-W-Payne/CIND820/blob/main/df%20processed.csv), which is then used for modeling in [dataset modeling.Rmd](https://github.com/Andrew-W-Payne/CIND820/blob/main/dataset%20modeling.Rmd).
